## About
I am a young student driven by a passion for data. Recognizing this passion, I have taken the initiative to independently explore and acquire foundational knowledge in data-related fields. Moreover, I have had the opportunity to gain practical experience through various data analysis internships. 
I have undertaken personal projects to further develop my skills in data analysis. This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics
